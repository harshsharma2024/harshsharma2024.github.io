[NOTE]
Currently I am covering the brief overview of the project, I will soon be updating it with the Exact Architecture and Github Code link.

```

## Project Overview

In this project, I successfully dockerized the components of a full-stack application, which includes a **ReactJS frontend** powered by **Vite**, a **FastAPI backend**, and a **PostgreSQL database**. The project also integrates **Google APIs** to access and manage data from spreadsheets, ensuring seamless data handling and real-time updates.

### Components
  
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: The backend is powered by FastAPI, known for its speed and performance. It handles API requests and communicates with the PostgreSQL database to retrieve and store data.

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: A PostgreSQL database is used for storing application data. The backend interacts with this database through efficient queries, ensuring fast data retrieval and persistence.

- **Frontend (ReactJS with Vite)**: The ReactJS application is built using Vite, providing fast build times and an optimized development experience. It interacts with the FastAPI backend to fetch and display data.

- **Google API Integration**: The project leverages Google APIs to access Google Sheets. This integration allows the backend to retrieve, update, and manipulate spreadsheet data in real-time, providing seamless synchronization between the app and external data sources.

### Dockerization

Each component (frontend, backend, and database) is containerized using **Docker** to ensure consistent environments and simplify deployment. Docker enables quick scaling and isolated environments for each service, making the application easy to manage and deploy on various platforms.

### Key Features:
- **Containerized Microservices**: Frontend, backend, and database run in isolated Docker containers.
- **Fast API**: High-performance backend built with FastAPI.
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, scalable database for data storage.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Real-time access and manipulation of spreadsheet data through Google APIs.

### Conclusion

By Dockerizing the frontend, backend, and database components, this project demonstrates how to efficiently build, deploy, and scale a full-stack application. The integration of Google APIs enhances the application's capability by providing seamless spreadsheet access, making it a robust and scalable solution for modern web applications.
